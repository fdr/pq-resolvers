Okay, I have a patch that does something *like* (but not the same) as
this, and whose implementation is totally unreasonable, but it's
enough to get a sense of how the whole thing feels.  Critically, it
goes beyond askpass, instead allowing a shell-command based hook for
arbitrary interpretation and rewriting of connection info...such as
the 'host' libpq keyword.  I have called it, without much thought, a
'resolver'.  In this way, it's closer to the libpq 'service' facility,
except with addition of complete control of the interpretation of
user-provided notation.

I think it would be useful to have an in-process equivalent
(e.g. loading hooks via dynamic linking, like the backend), if the
functionality seems worthwhile, mostly for performance and a richer
protocol between libpq and resolvers (error messages come to mind).  I
think with a bit of care this also would allow other drivers to more
easily implement some of the features grown into libpq (by re-using
the shared-object's protocol, or a generic wrapper that can load the
shared object to provide a command line interface), like the .pgpass
file and the services file, which are often missing from new driver
implementations.

With these disclaimers out of the way, here's a 'demo'.  It's long,
but hopefully not as dense as it first appears since it's mostly a
narration of walking through using this.

Included alongside the patch is a short program that integrates with
the freedesktop.org secret service standard, realized in the form of
libsecret (I don't know exactly what the relationship is, but I used
libsecret's documentation[0]).  This resolver I wrote is not a solid
piece of work either, much like the libpq patch I've attached...but, I
probably will try to actually make personal use of this for a time
after fixing a handful of things to feel it out over an extended
period.

On Debian, one needs gir1.2-secret-1 and Python 2.7.  I run this on
Ubuntu Raring, and have traced my steps using the GNOME Keyring used
there, Seahorse.

# This tool has some help:
$ ./pq-secret-service -h
$ ./pq-secret-service store -h
$ ./pq-secret-service recall -h

# Store a secret:
$ printf 'dbname=regression host=localhost port=5432 user=user'\
' password=password' | ./pq-secret-service store

Now, you can check your keyring manager, and search for 'postgres' or
'postgresql'.  You should see a stored PostgreSQL secret, probably
labeled "PostgreSQL Database Information"

After having compiled a libpq with my patch applied and making sure a
'psql' is using that libpq...

# Set the 'resolve' command:
$ export PGRESOLVE='/path/to/pq-secret-service recall'

# Attempt to connect to regression database.  The credentials are
# probably not enabled on your database, and so you'll see the
# appropriate error message instead.
$ psql regression

What this does is searches the keyrings in the most straightforward
way given the Secret Service protocol to try to 'complete' the input
passed, based on any of the (non-secret) parts of the passed conninfo
to 'pq-secret-service store'.

Here's an example where the resolver opts to not load something from
the keyring:

$ psql 'dbname=regression user=not-the-one-stored'

Now the resolver doesn't find a secret, so it just passes-through the
original connection info.  Ditto if one passes a password.  Here are
more examples, this time explored by invoking the resolver command
directly, without having to go through libpq.  This makes testing and
experimentation somewhat easier:

$ echo $(printf 'regression' | ./pq-secret-service recall)
$ echo $(printf 'dbname=regression' | ./pq-secret-service recall)
$ echo $(printf 'host=localhost port=5432' | ./pq-secret-service recall)

# Show failing to match the secret (the input provided will be
# returned unchanged):
$ echo $(printf 'host=elsewhere port=5432' | ./pq-secret-service recall)

In some aspects the loose matching is kind of neat, because usually
some subset of database names, role names, and host names are
sufficient to find the right thing, but this is besides the point: the
resolver program can be made very strict, or lax, or can even try
opening a database connection to feel things out.  I do want to make
sure that at least some useful baseline functionality can be
implemented, though, so wrangling the details of one or more
defensible sample resolver program is something I want to do.

In addition, there are two more advanced features in the
'pq-secret-service' resolver: labels, and shorthands.  These are *not*
concepts seen in the patch to libpq, whose main feature in this is the
ability to hand off the user's input to some arbitrary other program.

'label's are part of the Secret Service, and provide a human readable
entry in one's keyring program.  I default it to "PostgreSQL Database
Information".  It is not used in matching credentials and connection
information in any way:

$ printf 'dbname=regression host=localhost port=5432 user=user'\
' password=password' |                                         \
  ./pq-secret-service store                                    \
  --label='My Secure Postgres Regression Database'

Then, check your keyring program.  It'll probably display 'My Secure
Postgres Regression Database' somewhere.  If you ran the previous
steps, you will get a message like this:

    Adding this secret would be ambiguous with another keyring entry
    with the attributes: {'user': 'user', 'host': 'localhost',
    'dbname': 'regression', 'port': '5432'}

In this way, resolvers can also be useful independent programs: libpq
wouldn't nominally invoke the 'store' action at all, it only cares
about 'recall'.  You can delete the old credentials from your keyring
to successfully run this command (I don't know how to do that working
from the docs[0]).  But, given the label is not semantically
significant to libpq, you can opt to continue without doing that...

Moving on, 'shorthands' are a jargon of my hand (and not a Secret
Service feature, unlike 'label') that are very similar to service
definitions and the feature that I want the most badly:

$ printf 'dbname=regression host=localhost port=5432 user=user'
' password=password' | ./pq-secret-service store --shorthand=regress

$ psql regress

Note that this is ambiguous with database names: shorthands take
priority over the implicit-dbname connection string form.
Furthermore, they don't need to follow any libpq quoting rules: if
it's database-name-like, it is passed to the resolver verbatim, and if
it's connection-string-like, the resolver gets to have a look before
running any libpq parser (which might reject the input).  I think this
property of complete control to interpret user input is very
important.

Demo done.

Next demo:

What follows is a different use case entirely: client side proxying.
Shown below is an interaction with a pgbouncer resolver (also included
in this mail), as is useful to an application that uses a fork-based
web server and wants pooling, but doesn't want to run centralized
pgbouncer infrastructure.  The multiplexing of, say, four or more
forked backends to one pgbouncer, even pushed to the client, can be
operationally really useful.

WARNING: this program will litter some temporary files in /tmp
(prefixed with pgbouncer, to assist in deletion), and is missing some
useful features, and is suspect to port clashing if one is already
running pgbouncer with default settings.

$ export PGRESOLVE=/path/to/pq-pgbouncer-resolver
$ psql 'dbname=regression host=elsewhere user=someone password=secret'

This resolver assumes it can start up pgbouncer on its default port
(6432) should it not already be started.  When doing this, it sets up
pgbouncer configuration files in a particular way to be able to
service the user's passed connection string that triggered the
pgbouncer start-up.  After that, this implementation assumes that all
connections are going to the same place, not taking care to update
pgbouncer's configuration to 'learn' new database routes.

Beyond the start-up step, the resolver is pretty simple: it overwrites
the host and port libpq keywords in the conninfo passed by the user to
point at the started pgbouncer, so what happens is the resolution
yields:

 host=/tmp port=6432 dbname=regression user=someone password=secret'

Demo done.

Next Demo, a short one:

$ export PGRESOLVE='pq-secret-service recall | pq-pgbouncer-resolver'
$ psql theshorthand

This will expand the shorthand using one's keyring, and then
subsequently pipe the output of that to the pgbouncer resolver, which
can do its deed to get the connection to use pgbouncer.

Thanks for getting through all that text.  Fin.  And, thoughts?
